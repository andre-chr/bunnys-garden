# Bunny's Garden

## Project Description
A web-based game targetted for children aged 5-9 with the aim of instilling sustainable practices to children through giving
them the experience of growing a virtual plant. The problem statement for this project is: "As a parent who feels frustrated about the lack of awareness their child has about sustainability and needs
to teach their child about sustainable practices but does not have a media that is engaging to do so."

Team Aztecs is keen on creating a web-based game which not only serves as an entertaining game for kids,
but also educates them about the process of growing various plants and ways to be sustainable. Since many
parents do not have big gardening spaces in their residences, it is difficult to teach kids about the process
of planting a tree. This game ensures that the child learns about the process of how to grow a plant to negate
CO2 emissions which ultimately contributes to the sustainability of the planet. The game will also show
fun facts about the plant to help children gain more knowledge on the plants they are growing.
